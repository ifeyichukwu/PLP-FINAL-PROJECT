# Global EcoFootprint Calculator

A Streamlit-based web application that calculates and visualizes personal carbon footprints with region-specific calculations for Global and African contexts.

## Project Overview
The Global EcoFootprint Calculator helps users understand their environmental impact by calculating their annual carbon footprint based on lifestyle choices. It provides specialized calculations for both global users and African contexts, considering regional differences in energy sources and lifestyle patterns.

## Features
The project includes the following key functionalities:
- **Region-Specific Calculations**: Tailored carbon footprint calculations for Global and African contexts, including country-specific electricity grid emission factors
- **Comprehensive Impact Assessment**: Analyzes carbon emissions across three main categories:
  - Housing (electricity, cooking gas, heating)
  - Transport (car, motorcycle, public transport, flights)
  - Diet (various dietary patterns)
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic charts showing breakdown of carbon footprint using Plotly
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Custom suggestions for reducing carbon footprint based on user's results
